[Programming assignments of CS391 Computer Networking](http://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~yzhu/courses/comnet_18fall/)
## [Programming Assignment 1](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%231)
Complete all the following four tasks. <br>
1 [Web Server](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%231/WebServer) <br>
2 [UDP Pinger](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%231/UDPPinger) <br>
3 [Mail Client](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%231/MailClient) <br>
4 [Web Proxy Server](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%231/WebProxyServer) <br>
I also write a simple description [report](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/blob/master/Assignment%231/Report%231.pdf)  of this assignment.
## [Programming Assignment 2](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%232)
Mininet & Performance. <br>
### Step 1.   [Iperfer](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%232/Iperfer) <br>
I write a [Iperfer.java](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%232/Iperfer/src/Iperfer.java) to implement my own version of iperf to measure network bandwidth using sockets.
### Step 2.[Mininet Tutorial](http://mininet.org/walkthrough/) <br>
Learn to run and interact with Mininet.
### Step 3.[Measurements in Mininet](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%232/measurement/)
I use the tool `ping` and my own tool `Iperfer` to measure the mininet and get the results. There is also a [answers.txt](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%232/measurement/answers.txt) for the 4 questions.
## [Programming Assignment 3](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%233)
Link & Network Layer Forwarding. <br>
I write a [virtual switch](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/blob/master/Assignment%233/progAssign2/src/edu/wisc/cs/sdn/vnet/sw/Switch.java) and a [virtual router](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/blob/master/Assignment%233/progAssign2/src/edu/wisc/cs/sdn/vnet/rt/Router.java) to work on the configuration topologies.
## [Programming Assignment 4](https://github.com/louisja1/ComputerNetworkingAssignments/tree/master/Assignment%234)
ARP, ICMP, and RIP. <br>
I reinforce the [router family] and [Main]  of Assignment 3 with ICMP, ARP, and RIP.
